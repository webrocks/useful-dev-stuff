[Sass-lint page](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint)

## How to start
1. Copy sass-lint-global.yml to directory with your main *.scss files
2. Use "sass-lint --config sass-lint-global.yml -v -q" command (CLI is used for testing) to start
3. Check generated sass-lint-global.html for errors
4. If no sass-lint-global.html was created you are either have no issues or doing something wrong (try to make intentional error and see if sass-lint-global.html is generated)
